		<p>Starcatcher was the first web app I created. This game was created using the Phaser framework and Javascript along with HTML/CSS elements. The goal of this project was to create a game that you can play in the browser that would have a scoring function. My inspiration for this game came from playing Monkey Maze as a child.</p>

		<p>TicTacNope was created as a partner project with another student. This game was inspired by the 2016 election season. To create the foundation/logic of TicTacNope we used Javascript and then used CSS/HTML elements for styling. The views of this game are not an expression of my personal views.</p>
