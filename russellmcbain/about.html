    <h2>My name is Russell McBain<br><br> I am 27 years old and live in Chicago with my three dogs<br><br> I received my bachelors degree from Columbia College Chicago. I continued my studies at General Assembly in Chicago, joining the Web Development Immersive 3 month program. I am creator at heart and a traveler on the side. I am always within reach of my camera, which allows me to document as many experiences as possible. I love to work with people from different backgrounds and contribute any way possible. In my freetime I am a dreamer who is always thinking ahead about technology on the horizon and the impact it will have on the world. I look forward to helping every step of the way.<br><br>
