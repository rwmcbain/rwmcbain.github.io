  <h2>My name is Russell McBain. I received my bachelors degree from Columbia College Chicago. I continued my studies at General Assembly in Chicago, joining the Web Development Immersive 3 month program. I am creator at heart and a traveler on the side.  I am always within reach of my camera, and I try to document as many experiences as possible. I love to work with people from all different backgrounds and contribute in any way possible and am excited to embark on a career shaping the face of the web.</h2>
